In order to run the simulation:
mpirun -np 8 ./lbsim config.dat

Note: the code is designed to run only with 8 processes (as this was a short-time
implementation).

You may change the configuration in the config.dat file.
You may produce different pgm files with the matlab script flagfield_generator.m.
